Rhombus has facility to provide single-sign-on mechanism with the following requirements:

- client apps should have identical parent domain so that Rhombus' auth cookie can be shared

Setting up:

- use identical rhombus.authsecret and rhombus.authcookie as master
- set rhombus.authhost to master host
- add identical UserClass in client apps, with following options:
	- autoadd: non-existant local users will be created automatically
- for group sync, use this notation: sync:GROUP_NAME in auth host, and
  create corresponding GROUP_NAME in client host (without sync:)
